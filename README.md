# Hospital department

Prerequisite:

There are 6 doctors working in the hospital department. The house rules forbid leaving the ward when there are fewer than 3 doctors left. 

Main part:

You need to create an appendix with two pages. The first page should list all the doctors (staff) in a table with columns: id, full name, date of birth in the format dd.mm.yyyyy. The table should be sorted by full name. By clicking on the name of an employee, the user should get to the second page where the table should display a list of time intervals of the doctor's presence in the hospital department. 

Additional part:

Highlight in red the times when a physician's departure from the department involved a violation of the housekeeping rule.
